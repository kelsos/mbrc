MusicBee Remote - for Android
=============================
About
-------
MusicBee is a remote control application that is used to control [MusicBee](http://getmusicbee.com/) player using a network connected Android device. The application is freely available through [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kelsos.mbrc) and also requires the associated [plugin](https://github.com/kelsos/mbrc-plugin) (dll) for MusicBee to function.

The application uses TCP sockets to pass JSON encoded messages for communication.

MusicBee Remote was presented as part of my thesis on "*Android and application development for mobile devices*".

You can find help on how to use the application and more info on the dedicated [website](http://kelsos.net/musicbeeremote/) along with links to the binary version of the plugin.

You can also find information about the plugin and the remote to the dedicated topic in the [MusicBee forums](http://getmusicbee.com/forum/index.php?topic=7221.new;topicseen#new).

### Artwork

Many of the icons used are created by [Tasos Papazoglou Chalikias](https://github.com/sushiperv) and are licenced under the [Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs 3.0 Unported License.](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/3.0/deed.en_US) some of them where taken by other projects and some awful icons during the earlier development where created by me. The original logo idea belongs to Jordan Georgiades. Any other icons introduced in version 0.9.7 and later was probably my work. Some design ideas are based on [mockups](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/musicbee-remote/wgm029yfJnU) by Carlos Parga

### Inspiration
Initially a great source of inspiration for this project was the [Cyanogen Apollo player](https://github.com/CyanogenMod/android_packages_apps_Apollo)
along with [Google Play Music for Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.music). Nowadays I am looking closely the material design documentation.
